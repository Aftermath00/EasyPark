# Eazy Park

EZPark is an Android app that simplifies the parking ticketing process and reduces paper waste. Users register their vehicles and securely store their information. They can access parking sites by scanning a barcode or using NFC technology. The app automatically reserves parking slots upon successful scanning and calculates fees when users exit. EZPark is versatile and can be utilized by malls, co-working spaces, hotels, and more. EZPeezy Corporation manages the parking system's data to improve software development.
